Camera Array
============

An iOS application that allows devices to join a photo shoot connecting multiple cameras
and photographers. One device is required as a host and will not take photos itself. Once
one device has entered the host mode any devices in the same wifi hotspot are able to join
the photo shoot. Each joined device will send the photographed images to the host device.
The host device can view a real time photo gallery.

The project was started as an iOS learning experiment for course at Aalto University,
Department of Media Technology.
